# Prep - Audio Recording & Management App

A modern, production-ready web application for recording, saving, and managing audio communications. Built with React, Vite, and Firebase.

## Project Overview

Core user flow:

3. Save and review recordings in the Library.
4. Share, download, or remove recordings as needed.
